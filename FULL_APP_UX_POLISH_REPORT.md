# Full App UX Polish Report

## Callback and Selection Decision Workflow — June 29, 2026

**Goal:** Make the CALLBACK → FINAL_ROUND → SELECTED journey clear and safe for Talent, give recruiters a bounded talent-visible note field, and surface stage-specific decision guidance in both the Talent applications tracker and the Recruiter review room.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Shared lib helpers** (`app/lib/application-pipeline.ts`): `getTalentStageGuidance`, `getDecisionSafetyCue`, `validateTalentVisibleNote`, and `TALENT_VISIBLE_NOTE_MAX_LENGTH` are now exported and tested. `RecruiterReviewInput` extended with `talentNextStepNote`.
- **TalentStageCard** (`/applications`): Replaces the single-line "Next step" box with a tonal stage card — headline + detail per status, optional recruiter note block (amber border), safety cue for sensitive stages, and a check-messages hint. Stage tones: emerald (SELECTED), amber (CALLBACK/FINAL_ROUND), gray (REJECTED/WITHDRAWN), teal (all others).
- **Talent-visible note field** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): Added a bounded textarea (amber border, 400-char cap) in the Private casting notes aside. Contact details are blocked on blur and on save. The field is Talent-visible; it is clearly distinguished from the private Recruiter note. The decision safety cue appears in the Next action panel for CALLBACK/FINAL_ROUND/SELECTED.
- **API and schema** (`app/api/applications/route.ts`, `app/lib/types.ts`): `talentNextStepNote` is accepted, validated, trimmed, and persisted through the existing Admin SDK PATCH route. No Firestore rules change needed.
- **4 new unit tests** (`tests/application-pipeline.test.mts`): `getTalentStageGuidance`, `getDecisionSafetyCue`, `validateTalentVisibleNote`, and `validateRecruiterReview` with `talentNextStepNote`. Total: 83 tests, all passing.

See `CALLBACK_SELECTION_DECISION_WORKFLOW_REPORT.md` for the full change list and verification results.

## Audition Submission Studio and Casting Review Room — June 29, 2026

**Goal:** Make the audition application and recruiter applicant-review experience feel like a premium casting operating system by surfacing the "Application Pack" concept, extracting shared helpers into the lib, adding trust/safety cues, and backing everything with tests.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Shared lib helpers** (`app/lib/application-pipeline.ts`): `TALENT_NEXT_STEP_MESSAGES`, `getApplicationNextStep`, `getRecruiterNextAction`, `ApplicationPackSummary`, and `getApplicationPackSummary` are now exported and tested. Previously these were inline objects/functions buried in page components.
- **Application Pack in audition detail** (`/auditions/[id]`): The Talent apply aside now shows a concise "Application pack" bullet list — profile snapshot, bio, portfolio media, cover message, and self-tape (with required/optional distinction) — so Talent know exactly what the recruiter receives before submitting.
- **Pack chip strip in applications tracker** (`/applications`): Each application card now shows a "Pack" chip row — Profile snapshot (always included), Cover message (teal when present, muted when missing), and Self-tape pending/submitted (when the audition requires one). Derived from `getApplicationPackSummary`.
- **Pack chips in recruiter review room** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): The compact `ApplicantCard` chip row now includes Cover message and Self-tape chips alongside the existing category/experience/location/completeness chips — giving the recruiter an at-a-glance pack summary before expanding.
- **Casting integrity safety notice** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): A `SafetyNotice` below the NextActionPanel reminds recruiters never to request payment, deposits, or personal financial details from applicants.
- **3 new unit tests** (`tests/application-pipeline.test.mts`): `getApplicationNextStep`, `getRecruiterNextAction`, and `getApplicationPackSummary` (4 edge cases). Total: 79 tests, all passing.

See `AUDITION_SUBMISSION_STUDIO_CASTING_REVIEW_ROOM_REPORT.md` for the full change list and verification results.

## Trust-Verified Media and Document Upload System - June 29, 2026

**Goal:** Add the controlled Firebase Storage upload foundation for trustworthy Talent media and Recruiter verification evidence without adding video upload, payments, AI, fake data, or security shortcuts.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Shared upload policy** (`app/lib/upload-policy.ts`): Centralized MIME type validation, size limits, portfolio image count, safe filename normalization, and user-scoped Storage path generation.
- **Talent media** (`components/talent-media-manager.tsx`): Profile photo and portfolio image copy now explains privacy, ownership, 5 MB image limits, and a 6-image portfolio cap.
- **Recruiter verification** (`/recruiter/verification`): Recruiters can upload private JPEG/PNG/WebP/PDF evidence with progress, metadata display, and remove/open controls before submission.
- **Admin verification queue** (`/admin/verifications`): Admin can review evidence metadata and open private evidence files from the operational verification queue.
- **Storage security** (`storage.rules`): Recruiter evidence is private to the owning Recruiter and Admin users; Talent portfolio image size is tightened to 5 MB.

See `TRUST_VERIFIED_MEDIA_DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_SYSTEM_REPORT.md` for security notes, rules summary, known limitations, and manual QA.

## Real Launch Demo and Marketplace Content Pass - June 29, 2026

**Goal:** Make Nata Connect feel launch-ready when the database has little or no live content, without adding fake data, fake metrics, fake testimonials, backend features, or security changes.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Landing page** (`/`): Added a launch-ready marketplace section and an honest roadmap card that distinguishes current workflow support from future video upload, document upload, payments, AI, and automation.
- **Talent first-time flow** (`/auditions`, `/applications`, `/dashboard`, `/talent/profile`): Empty states and guidance now explain saving versus applying, first application messages, profile readiness, and safe public portfolio behavior.
- **Recruiter first-time flow** (`/dashboard`, `/recruiter/auditions`, `/recruiter/auditions/new`, `/recruiter/profile`, `/recruiter/verification`): First brief guidance, form placeholders, company bio guidance, and verification status copy now feel more practical and launch-ready.
- **Communication surfaces** (`/messages`, `/notifications`): Empty states now include role-aware next actions instead of passive "nothing here" copy.
- **Applicant review** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): Empty state now gives public-brief and safe-sharing guidance when there are no applicants or filters hide results.

See `REAL_LAUNCH_DEMO_MARKETPLACE_CONTENT_REPORT.md` for the full page review, known limitations, and manual launch QA checklist.

## Cinematic Product Design and Flow Transformation Pass — June 25, 2026

**Goal:** Make FirstTake / Nata Connect feel like a modern cinematic casting operating system rather than a generic marketplace or dashboard collection. Improve product flow clarity without changing backend logic, permissions, Firebase config, schemas, or tests.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Product primitives** (`components/product-ui.tsx`): Added `CinematicSectionHeader`, `NextActionPanel`, `FlowStepCard`, and `TrustCueCard` to make major pages communicate one clear next action, trust cue, and section rhythm.
- **Landing page** (`/`): Repositioned the product around verified casting, portfolio-first discovery, connected casting records, and clear account/login CTAs. Public CTA copy now says "Join the network" instead of "Join the beta".
- **Talent flow** (`/auditions`, `/auditions/[id]`, `/applications`): Added casting radar, safe application path, and application pipeline panels while preserving save, filter, apply, self-tape, and status logic.
- **Recruiter flow** (`/recruiter/auditions`, `/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): Added casting-room and casting-board guidance panels around existing publish, applicant review, status, notes, self-tape, and messaging controls.
- **Communication flow** (`/messages`, `/notifications`): Added casting communication center, trust cue, and role-aware activity timeline panels.

See `CINEMATIC_PRODUCT_DESIGN_FLOW_TRANSFORMATION_REPORT.md` for the full audit, known limitations, and manual checklist.

## Final Production QA and Live Validation Pass — June 24, 2026

**Goal:** Validate the whole application as one connected product after all recent UX upgrade passes. Confirm all three user journeys, mobile/laptop usability, safety/trust messaging, and deployment readiness. Fix only clear issues found — no redesign or new features.

Six targeted fixes applied:

- **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Auth error block `<p>` missing `rounded-md` — fixed. Recruiter hero CTA "Post an audition" → "Post a casting brief" — the auditions list WorkspaceHero, the quick-action card on the same dashboard view, and the form page itself all use "casting brief" language; the hero was the only outlier.
- **`app/auth/login/page.tsx`**: "Current tab session" info box missing `rounded-md` — fixed. This box appears when the user is already authenticated in the same tab and shows their email with a "Continue" button; all other bordered info blocks in the product have `rounded-md`.
- **`app/admin/reports/page.tsx`**: Three bordered blocks missing `rounded-md` — reporter note (gold left-border highlight), "Safe evidence snapshot" `<details>`, and "Audit trail" `<details>` — all fixed. Admin uses these blocks when reviewing every report.

All other pages, routes, CTAs, copy, navigation flows, and error/loading states were found to be correct. No route failures, broken links, TypeScript errors, or test failures. Lint: ✓, 70/70 tests: ✓, build: ✓, 55 routes.

See `FINAL_PRODUCTION_QA_LIVE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for the full journey-by-journey audit, manual live check checklist, and deployment notes.

## Mobile Responsiveness and App-Like Polish Upgrade — June 24, 2026

**Goal:** Make the application feel smoother, cleaner, and more app-like on mobile and laptop screens across all major user journeys. Audit every relevant screen and component for layout, spacing, touch targets, overflow, and visual consistency.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **`components/async-state.tsx`**: Added `rounded-md` to `LoadingState` and `ErrorState`. The `EmptyState` component already used the `surface` class (which includes `rounded-md`), but the other two async states had flat edges. Now all three async-state primitives are visually consistent — used across approximately 14 pages.
- **`app/auditions/[id]/page.tsx`**: Added `order-first lg:order-none` to `<aside>`. On mobile, the apply CTA (cover message textarea and submit button) now appears above the article. On desktop the two-column layout is unchanged — article on the left, aside on the right. Talent arriving from the discovery list already know the role title; the immediate mobile action is deciding to apply, not scrolling through the full brief first.
- **`app/recruiter/auditions/new/page.tsx`**: Changed h1 from `text-4xl font-black` to `text-2xl font-black sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl`. The page heading was oversized on mobile viewports — it now uses the same responsive scale as `WorkspaceHero` across all other workspace pages.
- **`app/recruiter/verification/page.tsx`**: Added `rounded-md` to the post-submission success message and to the admin review-note block. Both were missing corner rounding that all other inline feedback blocks in the product already have.

See `MOBILE_RESPONSIVENESS_APP_LIKE_POLISH_REPORT.md` for the full audit, inspected files, and manual test checklist.

## Role Onboarding and First-Session Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make the first-session experience feel professional, guided, and clear. Remove the last of the beta language from the entry points, fix branding inconsistencies in the email verification flow, and surface real onboarding progress in the Recruiter dashboard checklist.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Signup page** (`/auth/signup`): Removed the "Private beta — controlled rollout" banner that appeared above the role picker for every new user — the product should speak for itself at the most important conversion moment. Error block changed from red to amber styling, consistent with validation error convention throughout the app.
- **Login page** (`/auth/login`): Error block changed from red to amber styling — wrong password is user-recoverable input feedback, not a system failure.
- **Email verified page** (`/auth/email-verified`): Four "FirstTake" → "Nata Connect" branding fixes across the `verified`, `signed_out`, and `checking` state description strings, plus the trust-explanation body visible in all states. This page is the highest-trust moment in onboarding — the user has just proven they own their email address.
- **Email verification prompt** (`components/email-verification-prompt.tsx`): One "FirstTake" → "Nata Connect" branding fix in the status message shown after a verification email is sent. This prompt appears on the Talent profile, Recruiter profile, and Recruiter dashboard.
- **Recruiter onboarding checklist** (`/dashboard`): Fixed hardcoded `done: true` on the "Complete your company profile" step. The dashboard now tracks recruiter profile data in state (`recruiterProfile`), derives `profileReady = Boolean(companyName && bio)`, and passes it to the checklist. A new Recruiter no longer sees a pre-checked profile step the moment they land on the dashboard.

See `ROLE_ONBOARDING_FIRST_SESSION_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

## Trust, Safety and Reporting Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make FirstTake / Nata Connect feel safer and more trustworthy for real casting use. Give Talent clear guidance on scam prevention, reinforce safe communication across messaging, strengthen admin reports with priority context, and escalate the most dangerous report types.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Safety page** (`/safety`): Completely restructured as a practical safety center. New "Red Flags for Fake Casting Calls" section names payment requests, off-platform pressure, and unverifiable recruiters. New "How to Report" and "What Happens After You Report" sections explain the reporting process and outcome. CTA changed from `/beta-feedback` to `/community-guidelines`. All nine sections rewritten for clarity and casting context.
- **Community guidelines** (`/community-guidelines`): Description updated to name consequences. "Reporting Abuse" removes "where available" qualifier — the trust team always reviews reports. Section renamed "Consequences of Violations" with permanent suspension language added.
- **Messages inbox** (`/messages`): Page description "until trust is established" removed — now reads "never share personal contact details in messages" (consistent with sidebar policy).
- **Conversation detail** (`/messages/[conversationId]`): `getThreadSafetyReminder` fixed "FirstTake" → "Nata Connect" in both Talent and Recruiter variants — a branding inconsistency visible on every conversation load.
- **Admin reports queue** (`/admin/reports`): AdminPageHeader explains what urgent and high priority reports represent. Empty state message is now filter-aware. Reporter note block gains a "Reporter note" label.
- **Report priority policy** (`app/lib/report-policy.ts`): `scam_or_fraud` and `unsafe_contact_request` escalated from `'high'` to `'urgent'`; `impersonation` and `fake_audition` escalated from `'medium'` to `'high'`; `misleading_information` from `'low'` to `'medium'`. Reporter notification message improved. Tests updated.

See `TRUST_SAFETY_REPORTING_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

## Recruiter Audition Creation and Publishing Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make the recruiter audition creation workflow feel like a guided casting brief builder. Give recruiters field-level guidance, reinforce safety at the point of self-tape instructions, connect compensation type to real-world meaning, and tie verification to publishing access.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **New casting brief form** (`/recruiter/auditions/new`): Header updated from abstract ("Shape the opportunity clearly.") to outcome-focused ("Build a casting call that attracts the right Talent."); error block red → amber; `Input` component extended with optional `helper` prop; helper text added to 10 key fields across all four form sections; safety note added beneath self-tape instructions textarea; max duration label clarified to "Clip duration limit (seconds)"; "Before you publish" checklist safety item `font-semibold` → `font-bold`.
- **Recruiter auditions list** (`/recruiter/auditions`): WorkspaceHero CTA "Post audition" → "Post a casting brief"; empty state updated to action-forward copy that names verified-recruiter response quality as a benefit.
- **Recruiter verification** (`/recruiter/verification`): Description extended to explain that verification enables publishing casting briefs and adds a verified badge — motivating recruiters to complete the step.

See `RECRUITER_AUDITION_PUBLISHING_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

---

## Messaging and Notifications Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make messaging and notifications feel like a professional casting communication center. Give Talent and Recruiters the context they need to act on casting updates, stay safe, and return to the right place.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Messages inbox** (`/messages`): Talent empty state made active; conversation type chip is now role-aware ("Audition conversation" for talent, "Applicant conversation" for recruiter) with "Archived" for archived threads; last-message fallback "Conversation ready" → "No messages yet"; inbox habits "early" → "Never" share contact details.
- **Conversation detail** (`/messages/[conversationId]`): Header eyebrow is role-aware; compose placeholder is casting-specific ("Message about the role, next steps, or self-tape."); compose error uses amber styling; aside description updated to "This conversation is linked to the casting call application. Keep next steps and decisions here."; trust section renamed "Platform safety"; return link is role-aware ("View in My Applications" / "Open applicant review").
- **Notifications** (`/notifications`): Per-category unread counts on all filter tabs (not just ALL); context-aware empty states per filter; error block uses amber styling; notification timestamp `font-semibold` → `font-bold`; empty heading for category tabs "No updates here" → "Nothing here yet".
- **Messaging policy** (`app/lib/messaging-policy.ts`): `buildConversationNotification` uses "Casting conversation started" title and casting-contextual messages.
- **MetricCard** (`components/product-ui.tsx`): Detail text `font-semibold` → `font-bold` globally.
- **ApplicationMessageButton** (`components/application-message-button.tsx`): Error text uses amber styling.

See `MESSAGING_NOTIFICATIONS_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

---

## Audition Discovery and Application Conversion Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make audition discovery feel like a serious casting marketplace. Give Talent the context they need to find the right roles, convert more save-to-apply, and submit with confidence.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Audition discovery page** (`/auditions`): `SafetyNotice` "Never pay to audition" added at page bottom; view description updated to `font-bold` with casting-specific copy; MetricCard visible-match detail updated from "Current search result" to "Matching this search"; empty state messages made action-oriented with clear next steps.
- **Casting brief detail** (`/auditions/[id]`): Apply aside gains a context sub-line ("Your profile and media are included automatically."); amber notice when audition is no longer accepting applications; button text adapts for unauthenticated users ("Log in to apply"); post-apply guidance text ("After applying, track your status in My Applications.") added below submit button.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): `nextStepMessages` in the Recent Applications widget updated to casting-specific language consistent with the Talent application tracker (e.g. CALLBACK → "You have a callback — watch for a message."; SELECTED → "You were selected. Expect a message with next steps.").

See `AUDITION_DISCOVERY_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

---

## Applicant Review and Casting Pipeline Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make the Recruiter applicant review workflow feel like a real casting pipeline and give Talent clearer guidance on what each application stage means.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Recruiter applicant review** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): Header gains audition meta line (Role, Deadline, Status); pipeline summary restructured from 11 to 8 compact metrics; UNDER_REVIEW ("Reviewing") and MAYBE tabs added; status timeline entries show status-specific descriptions with "Current —" prefix; "Next action" panel added in private casting notes aside with stage-specific guidance; timeline date `font-semibold` → `font-bold`.
- **Talent application tracker** (`/applications`): All 10 next-step messages updated with actionable, casting-specific language; view tab descriptions updated ("In review or awaiting recruiter action", "Shortlist, callback, and final round"); tab description font `font-semibold` → `font-bold`; `SafetyNotice` "Never pay to audition" added at page bottom.
- **Notification policy** (`app/lib/notification-policy.ts`): SHORTLISTED, CALLBACK, FINAL_ROUND, REJECTED, and SELECTED messages updated with clearer casting language.
- **Recruiter auditions list** (`/recruiter/auditions`): Mobile card "Next action:" text `font-semibold` → `font-bold`.

See `APPLICANT_PIPELINE_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

---

## Talent Portfolio and Recruiter Profile Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make Talent profiles, public portfolios, and Recruiter company profiles feel like serious casting-industry assets — not basic account management pages.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Talent profile editor** (`/talent/profile`): `font-semibold` → `font-bold` on all field labels; checkbox label updated to "Enable public portfolio page"; "private-beta" removed from verification pending copy.
- **Public Talent portfolio** (`/t/[slug]`): `rounded-md` added to profile card, photo, selected-work section, showreel link items, and professional-links section; skills and languages separated into two distinct labeled chip groups (Skills: neutral grey, Languages: teal-tinted); casting inquiry footer note added for non-authenticated visitors.
- **Recruiter profile editor** (`/recruiter/profile`): All form labels `font-semibold` → `font-bold`; amber "onboarding phase" notice inside casting-identity section replaced with `PrivacyNote` ("Platform safety expectation") enforcing the no-pay-to-audition rule.
- **Recruiter verification** (`/recruiter/verification`): All three occurrences of "private-beta" language removed — page title, success message, and documents section.
- **Applicant review** (`/recruiter/auditions/[id]/applicants`): Experience level chip added to compact card row; "Portfolio" action button links to `/t/[slug]` in a new tab; expanded Talent profile section separates skills and languages with labeled rows; "View public portfolio →" link added in expanded section; `ApplicantDetail` font fixed.

See `PROFILE_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit, before/after table, and manual test checklist.

---

## Core Application Experience Upgrade — June 23, 2026

**Goal:** Make the core product workflow feel like a premium, serious casting platform — not a private beta prototype. Focus on the pages Talent and Recruiters interact with most.

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Audition detail page** (`/auditions/[id]`): Full brand alignment — `surface` on article and aside, `font-black` throughout, teal back link, expanded detail grid (adds Project type, Work mode, Compensation, Languages), `SafetyNotice` "Never pay to audition" at the bottom, `primary-button` class on apply CTA, `rounded-md` on save button, expanded `Detail` and `Section` helper components with brand typography.
- **Applications page** (`/applications`): Inline amber error `<div>` replaced with branded `<ErrorState>` component; inline dashed empty-state replaced with `<EmptyState>` component; recruiter byline separator changed from dash to mid-dot `·`; status filter description updated from internal developer copy to user-facing product language.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Both onboarding checklists (Talent and Recruiter) updated from "Private beta — getting started" to "Getting started" — the checklists are permanent product guidance, not beta-specific.
- **Recruiter new audition** (`/recruiter/auditions/new`): Self-tape submission note updated from "For beta safety, self-tapes use unlisted/private links from trusted video platforms." to "Self-tapes use unlisted or private links from YouTube, Vimeo, or a similar platform." — permanent policy language, not a beta qualifier.
- **Messages page** (`/messages`): Page eyebrow updated from "Private casting communication" to "Casting inbox" — the user mental model.

See `CORE_APPLICATION_EXPERIENCE_UPGRADE_REPORT.md` for the full audit and before/after table.

---

## Design System Evolution Pass — June 22, 2026

**Goal:** Cinematic Trust Marketplace / Casting Operating System

Key improvements in this pass:

- **Status badge system**: Brand-aligned color palette (teal/gold arc/emerald/muted) replacing generic Tailwind colors. Every badge now has `border`, `rounded-md`, `tracking-wide`, `font-black uppercase`.
- **Audition cards**: New `Chip` component with 6 variants, cinematic left-border hover accent, card lift on hover, "View casting brief" CTA language, icon-annotated location and self-tape chips.
- **WorkspaceHero**: Subtle teal radial glow gradient for cinematic depth.
- **Recruiter auditions desktop**: HTML table replaced with card-row layout matching the mobile experience.
- **Application meta chips**: Brand label sizing consistent with global chip system.
- **Applicant talent chips**: `TalentChip` component with score (teal) and media (gold) tones replacing plain unstyled spans.

See `DESIGN_SYSTEM_EVOLUTION_REPORT.md` for the complete audit and component inventory.

## UX Audit Summary

Nata Connect now has a strong product foundation across Talent, Recruiter, and Admin workflows, but the audit found uneven page maturity. The most polished areas are the Talent dashboard, auditions discovery, applications tracker, messaging, notifications, and Admin command center. The weakest areas were profile pages and long forms, where users had to understand trust, public visibility, verification, media, and profile completeness from scattered sections.

The main UX risk was not missing functionality. It was unclear hierarchy: users could complete tasks, but they were not always guided through why each section matters, what is public, what is private, what is complete, and what to do next.

This pass also realigned the product around the FirstTake by MVA Studios
promise: "Where Talent Meets Opportunity." The experience now emphasizes
verified auditions, professional portfolios, self-tape workflows, application
tracking, recruiter review, and platform trust instead of generic dashboard
actions.

Email verification is now a real account-trust flow instead of static guidance.
Talent and Recruiter users can send a Firebase verification email, return after
opening the email link, refresh the Firebase user, and sync verified state to
their own user document through a secure token-verified server route.

## Pages Improved

- `/auditions`
- `/applications`
- `/recruiter/auditions`
- `/talent/profile`
- `/recruiter/profile`
- `/dashboard`
- `/notifications`
- `/`
- `/messages`
- `/messages/[conversationId]`

Recent previous polish also improved:

- `/auditions`
- `/applications`
- `/recruiter/auditions`
- `/recruiter/auditions/new`
- `/recruiter/verification`

## Dashboard CTA Logic

The Talent dashboard primary CTA now follows the casting journey instead of
promoting help, safety, or email verification as the main action.

Priority order:

1. Required self-tape missing: send Talent to applications with self-tape copy.
2. No applications yet: send Talent to browse auditions.
3. Saved auditions exist but no recent application: send Talent to saved auditions.
4. Unread recruiter message: send Talent to messages.
5. Profile below 100%: send Talent to complete profile.
6. Email not verified: show a secondary trust banner, not the hero CTA.
7. Otherwise: send Talent to browse new auditions.

Safety and help remain available as a secondary support card, not the hero
action.

The dashboard now includes opportunity-first sections for audition discovery,
application momentum, self-tape reminders, saved auditions, recruiter replies,
and safety/support.

## End-to-End Product Flow QA Pass

A full flow audit was completed across all Talent, Recruiter, and Admin routes
after the mobile product polish series. Nine P1 issues were identified and fixed.

### Issues Fixed

**Error copy sanitization (8 locations)**

Raw Firebase / Firestore error messages were being passed directly to the user
across audition detail, messages conversation, notifications, recruiter applicant
pipeline, create-audition form, admin action buttons, and application message
button. Each was replaced with a static product-safe recovery string ("We could
not complete this action. Try again in a moment." or "We could not load this
section. Try refreshing the page.").

**Unsupported CTA removal (2 locations)**

- `app/recruiter/auditions/new/page.tsx`: A disabled "Direct upload coming soon"
  checkbox was visible inside the self-tape section. It was removed along with the
  adjacent "Direct uploads remain a future feature" copy. Recruiters now see only
  the supported "External video link" option with appropriate guidance.
- `app/recruiter/verification/page.tsx`: A disabled "Document upload coming soon"
  button was visible at the bottom of the document section. It was removed and
  replaced with a security guidance note telling recruiters to keep sensitive
  identity documents out of public fields.

### What Remained the Same

- All Firestore rules, APIs, database schema, authentication logic, and Firebase
  configuration are unchanged.
- Dev presets (`DevFormPresets`, `DevTestCases`) are correctly gated behind
  `NODE_ENV === 'development'` and are not visible in production.
- The `/profile` route bridge works correctly for all three roles.
- Mobile safe-area padding is applied in `AppShell` and `AdminShell`.
- Admin action buttons correctly require a reason for all destructive actions.

### Test Results After This Pass

```
npm run lint   → Clean
npm test       → 68 / 68 pass
npm run build  → Success, 55 routes, 0 errors
```

## Email Verification Implementation

Added a reusable verification prompt for signed-in unverified users:

- Send verification email through Firebase Auth.
- Use the configured app URL when available, with browser origin fallback.
- Refresh verification status by reloading the Firebase user and forcing a
  fresh ID token.
- Sync `emailVerified: true` through `/api/auth/sync-email-verification` only
  after Firebase Admin verifies the current user's ID token.
- Keep email verification as a secondary trust banner/card, not the primary
  casting journey CTA.
- Check status quietly on mount, browser focus, and visibility changes.
- Poll for a short two-minute window after sending an email, then stop.
- Continue Firebase email links to `/auth/email-verified`.
- Use production `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://firsttake-lovable.vercel.app`
  so Firebase emails return users to the correct deployment.
- Include Spam/Promotions guidance before encouraging another resend.

The prompt appears on:

- Talent dashboard
- Recruiter dashboard
- Talent profile
- Recruiter profile

## Landing Page Alignment

The public landing page now leads with the core FirstTake pitch:

- "Where Talent Meets Opportunity."
- Discover verified auditions.
- Build a professional portfolio.
- Submit self-tapes.
- Track every casting response in one place.

It also explains the market problem of scattered audition discovery across
Instagram, WhatsApp, informal contacts, and unclear forms, then positions
FirstTake as a centralized verified casting workflow for Talent and Recruiters.

The latest consistency pass added a more explicit "How it works" section so the
public story connects Talent profiles, audition context, and recruiter casting
decisions in one professional workflow.

## Shared Product UI

Added `components/product-ui.tsx` for shared product-facing primitives:

- `WorkspaceHero`
- `MetricCard`
- `SectionHeader`
- `SafetyNotice`

These are intentionally small and are used where they remove repeated page
header, metric, and safety-note patterns without forcing a full app rewrite.

## Admin Experience Continuity

The Admin workspace now uses the same premium product language and layout
patterns as Talent and Recruiter areas while keeping all admin permissions and
data flows unchanged.

Improved Admin routes:

- `/admin`
- `/admin/verifications`
- `/admin/talents`
- `/admin/auditions`
- `/admin/audit-logs`

The dashboard now reads as a trust command center with verification queues,
platform trust metrics, moderation activity, and recent privileged actions.
Recruiter verification and Talent review now separate identity, profile
quality, portfolio state, and account safety decisions. Audition moderation now
distinguishes active, closed/draft, visible, and removed briefs. Audit logs now
translate internal action keys into readable labels while preserving the stored
action values.

The mobile Admin shell now follows the same app-like pattern as Talent and
Recruiter workspaces:

- Compact top brand header.
- Notification and menu controls aligned with the product shell.
- Full admin navigation moved into a mobile menu instead of a full-height
  sidebar.
- Bottom quick navigation for Dashboard, Verify, Moderate, Logs, and More.
- Main content starts immediately below the header with mobile-safe bottom
  padding for the navigation bar.

Secondary admin routes also received safer error copy so admins see clear
recovery language instead of implementation details. No Firestore rules,
schema, server actions, API permissions, or claim logic changed in this pass.

## Full Mobile Product QA

The latest mobile QA pass checked the public landing page plus Talent,
Recruiter, and Admin workspaces as one production product. The pass focused on
header consistency, bottom navigation, spacing, card readability, button reach,
loading and empty states, safe error copy, and avoiding horizontal overflow.

Safe UI fixes from the pass:

- Added `/profile` as a role-aware frontend bridge to the correct profile or
  Admin workspace.
- Replaced raw audited-route error messages with simple refresh guidance.
- Corrected the Telugu Nata Connect brand text in the shared logo and landing
  hero.
- Tuned Admin mobile bottom navigation labels for narrow phone widths.

No backend features, Firestore rules, APIs, schemas, permissions, auth logic, or
Firebase configuration changed.

The final mobile micro-polish pass tightened shared mobile hero spacing, softened
metric-card accent bars, increased shell bottom safe-area padding, shortened
Admin bottom navigation labels, and made compact email verification prompts less
bulky on mobile dashboards.

## Marketplace and Tracker Polish

The audition discovery page now feels more like a marketplace feed:

- Stronger page hero.
- Visible result, verified recruiter, saved role, and applied counts.
- Clearer transition between All auditions and Saved auditions.
- Search/filter controls remain compact and responsive.

The applications tracker now feels more like a casting status workspace:

- Active, Shortlisted, Self-tape, and Unread-thread metrics.
- Clearer primary actions to browse auditions or open messages.
- Product-safe error copy instead of implementation details.

The recruiter auditions page now reads more like a casting command center:

- Active call, applicant, self-tape, and draft metrics.
- Stronger review-applicants path.
- Professional safety standard reminding recruiters not to ask Talent to pay to
  audition.

## Profile Completion Logic

The Talent profile now explains why the score is not 100%. The score uses one
shared profile-completeness helper so Talent, Admin, dashboard, and
recruiter-facing reads do not drift.

Tracked completeness signals:

- Basic identity
- Category
- Experience
- Location
- Bio of at least 80 characters
- At least one portfolio signal: media, YouTube reel, or portfolio website
- Skills and languages

Optional trust and presentation signals are intentionally shown separately and
do not reduce the profile completeness percentage:

- Age, gender, and height
- Instagram/social context
- Profile photo
- Email verification
- Talent verification
- Public profile state
- Portfolio moderation state

The profile now shows:

- Completion percentage
- Exact missing items
- "Complete these to reach 100%" guidance
- Done, Missing, and Optional states
- Action links to the relevant profile section

The Admin Talent review view now uses the same live profile calculation, then
shows verification status, public profile state, and portfolio moderation in
separate fields. This prevents a stale verification submission snapshot from
showing a different percentage than the Talent profile.

Skills and languages are now editable from the Talent profile, so the user is
not blocked from reaching 100% by a hidden field.

## Profile Improvements

### Talent Profile

The Talent profile now has a clearer structure:

- Profile overview hero with name, completeness, verification, and public profile state.
- Readiness card showing profile completeness and verification messaging.
- Checklist explaining what recruiters look for, with Done/Missing/Optional states.
- Exact missing-item list explaining how to reach 100%.
- Privacy note explaining recruiter visibility, public profile visibility, and internal-only data.
- Form split into clear sections:
  - Basic identity
  - Casting details
  - Skills and languages
  - Portfolio links
- Sticky save action for easier mobile and desktop saving.
- Public profile preview action appears when a public slug exists.

### Recruiter Profile

The Recruiter profile now has:

- Company overview hero with verification, company info, and contact readiness.
- Trust readiness checklist.
- Exact trust setup gaps before the profile feels fully ready.
- Safety/trust note explaining recruiter responsibilities.
- Form split into clear sections:
  - Company details
  - Casting identity
- Sticky save action.
- Hero CTA that points to trust setup until ready, then audition creation.

## Talent Journey Improvements

The Talent journey is now clearer:

1. Dashboard surfaces next best action.
2. Profile explains completeness, verification, media, and public profile readiness.
3. Auditions page has a clear saved-auditions view and marks already-applied roles.
4. Audition cards surface verified recruiters, new roles, deadline urgency, work mode, compensation, and self-tape needs.
5. Applications page groups statuses into Active, Shortlisted, Completed, and All.
6. Application cards show deadline, recruiter, next-step copy, self-tape status, messaging, withdrawal, and a direct audition link.
7. Callback and Final Round now appear as explicit casting stages with respectful Talent-facing explanations.
8. Messages now feel like a real casting inbox.
9. Notifications now group application, message, audition, and trust updates so Talent can understand what changed without scanning a mixed feed.

Remaining Talent opportunities:

- Add URL persistence for applications filters.
- Add richer profile preview from the profile page when no public slug exists.
- Add direct resend email verification action.

## Recruiter Journey Improvements

The Recruiter profile now better explains the path from company setup to verification and publishing readiness.

The Recruiter dashboard copy was also aligned to the same product language:
verified audition posting, applicant review, self-tape review, shortlisting, and
safe on-platform messaging.

The Recruiter audition workspace now includes summary metrics for active calls,
total applicants, self-tape briefs, and drafts. Both mobile cards and desktop
tables now emphasize the primary next action: review applicants, then shortlist,
message, select, or close the pipeline.

The Recruiter applicant review workspace now shows audition context, deadline,
status, applicant totals, new/viewed/shortlisted/callback/final-round counts,
selected/rejected counts, and self-tape submissions. Applicant cards surface
Talent category, location, skills/languages, profile completeness, cover-note
preview, self-tape state, and fast actions to review, open self-tapes, shortlist,
move to Callback, move to Final Round, select, or reject. Expanded review keeps
the existing private notes, tags, ratings, portfolio preview, self-tape review,
messaging, and now includes a status timeline.

Recruiter verification keeps document upload disabled during beta, but no longer
mentions infrastructure constraints. The page now points recruiters toward
company details, website, social proof links, and production context for review.

Recruiters now also have a clearer route back to notifications from the
dashboard, so applicant messages, status activity, and trust updates are not
buried behind the bell alone.

## Messaging and Notifications Polish

The activity center now behaves more like a product inbox:

- Category tabs separate Applications, Messages, Auditions, and Trust / Account
  updates.
- Notification cards show an icon, category badge, unread state, timestamp, and
  a clear action label.
- Application-status copy is more human for Viewed, Shortlisted, Callback, Final
  Round, Selected, Rejected, and Withdrawn states.
- Viewed creates in-app activity, but remains out of email preference mapping to
  avoid noisy email delivery.

The message inbox now shows:

- Participant context by role.
- Audition title.
- Application status badge.
- Unread, active, and archived filters.
- Role-aware empty states.

The conversation thread now reinforces:

- Audition/application context.
- Current application status.
- Platform safety reminders.
- No payment requests and no sensitive document sharing in chat.

Remaining Recruiter opportunities:

- Continue refining `/recruiter/auditions/new` with richer inline validation and preview.
- Add dashboard next-best-action logic for profile incomplete, verification pending, no auditions, and applicant responses.
- Add richer applicant comparison tools once beta usage shows common review patterns.

## Admin Journey Improvements

Admin pages already use shared primitives such as:

- `AdminPageHeader`
- `AdminMetricCard`
- `AdminStatusBadge`
- `AdminActionGroup`
- `AdminDangerActionGroup`
- `AdminEmptyState`

Remaining Admin opportunities:

- Standardize filter/search bars across all Admin queues.
- Add more empty-state CTAs where queues are empty.
- Improve audit-log scanning with compact grouped metadata.
- Add stronger dangerous-action confirmation hierarchy where needed.

## Public and Support Page Findings

The public/support pages are functional and mostly consistent, especially landing, safety, help, legal, and beta feedback pages.

Remaining opportunities:

- Add a shared footer to public/support pages.
- Create a consistent support-page hero and card grid.
- Improve public Talent profile empty/missing-media states.

## Reusable Components Added

Added `components/profile-ui.tsx`:

- `ProfileHero`
- `ProfileStat`
- `ProfileSection`
- `ReadinessChecklist`
- `PrivacyNote`

These components make profile and trust-related pages feel like one system instead of separate forms.

## Remaining UX Limitations

- Some forms outside profile pages still feel long and should be grouped in future passes.
- Admin pages are consistent but could feel more like a command center with shared filters and queue cards.
- Public/support pages are readable but could use a more unified footer and page shell.
- Some CTAs depend on data that is not always available client-side, such as direct profile preview before slug creation.

## Future UX Recommendations

1. Create shared `PageHero`, `FilterBar`, `MetricCard`, and `ActionCard` components for all non-admin pages.
2. Refactor audition creation into progressive sections.
3. Add dashboard next-best-action logic for Recruiters.
4. Add direct notification-driven CTAs for self-tapes, reports, and verification states.
5. Add visual QA screenshots for key mobile widths before beta releases.

## Deployment Notes

No Firebase rules or schema changes are required for this UX pass. Vercel redeploy is required for the UI changes.

## Laptop Screen Recording UX Polish Pass (2026-06-22)

A targeted laptop-density pass based on screen recordings at 1280–1440px.
Observations covered 13 pages across all three roles.

### Key changes

- `WorkspaceHero` and `MetricCard` compacted globally
- Recruiter nav active-state bug fixed (`exact: true` on "Casting calls")
- `EmailVerificationPrompt` unified to one compact design
- Talent and Recruiter dashboard heroes compacted; sidebar cards tightened
- Messages chat area reduced; amber read-only banner added for closed conversations
- Recruiter applicant metrics grid reduced from 3 rows to 2 (6-column xl layout)
- "Before you publish" sidebar replaced with structured checklist
- Recruiter verification header and form spacing compacted
- Notifications header, filters, and cards tightened; redundant "Unread" badge removed
- Admin dashboard metric section spacing reduced

### Not changed

Talent profile long form, admin list-page hierarchy, and talent auditions/
applications density — all safe to defer. No backend, auth, or schema changes.
